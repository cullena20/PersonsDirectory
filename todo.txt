Implement tests for Persons.delete() and Persons.add()
Make sure inheritance is done properly and nothing is being implemented that can't be inherited 
(I got points off for this on previous assignment, ask about this)
Maybe modify code for modify and add records since it is very bulky and repeats stuff (and assignment says use getData())

For myself:
clean up code a bit and write it more elegantly
clean up formating with '\n' and stuff
add error checking
add some extra functionality perhaps
review oop principles and see how I am trying to follow them.
